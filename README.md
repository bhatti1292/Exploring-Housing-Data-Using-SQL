# Exploring-Housing-Data-Using-SQL

The code performs several SQL queries on a dataset called "housing.h". The dataset contains information about houses, including their area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, stories, whether they have air conditioning or not, and other features.

The first set of queries count the number of rows in the dataset and select the top 10 rows. The next set of queries performs statistical analysis on the price column, including finding the minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation of prices.

The following queries explore the dataset by looking at the number of houses with different numbers of bedrooms and bathrooms, and the average price of houses with different numbers of bedrooms and bathrooms.

The queries also examine the number of houses with air conditioning and the average price of houses with and without air conditioning.

The code also checks for null values in the dataset and identifies any duplicates based on certain criteria.

Lastly, the code examines the relationship between parking and house prices, as well as the relationship between furnishing status, air conditioning, and house prices.
